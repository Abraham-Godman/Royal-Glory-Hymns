                            Were brought before a tyrant’s throne<br>
                            They were told that he would spare their lives<br>
                            If they would renounce the name of Christ<br>
                            But one by one they chose to die<br>
                            The son of God they would not deny<br>
                            Like a great angelic choir sing<br>
                            I can almost hear their voices ring</p>

                            And now our time has come to count the cost<br>
                            To reject this world to embrace Christ<br>
                            And one by one let us live our lives<br>
                            For the one who died to give us life<br>
                            Till the trumpet sounds on the final day<br>
